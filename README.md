# FirebaseAuthExample
Template for firebase authentication, includes sign in, sign up, email verification, and password reset. 

## Getting Started
### Setting up firebase 
  To allow our front end to connect to firebase we first need to create an firebase with authentication and get the firebase config. This template require that you have email/password provider and an google provider. This can easily be changed to use no provider or add aditional providers. 
  1. Create firebase project or use existing project
  2. Add authentication to the project, select email/password with any additional provider you would like
  3. Add an web app to your project and copy the provided firebaseConfig JSON object
  
 ### Setting up the template
  Now that we have the firebase set up, we can begin setting up the project.
  1. Clone the project.
  2. Go to auth-example/src/firebase
  3. Update firebaseConfig to the one you copied earlier
 
 ### Run the template
